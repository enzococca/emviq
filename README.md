[EMviq (Extended Matrix Visual Inspector and Querier)](http://osiris.itabc.cnr.it/scenebaker/index.php/projects/emviq/) is a complete, interactive 4D visualization and runtime interrogation tool developed on top of [ATON framework](http://osiris.itabc.cnr.it/aton/) for [Extended Matrices](http://osiris.itabc.cnr.it/extendedmatrix/). The tool focuses on automatic extraction from GraphML files (EMs) targeting 3D visualization, ease-of-use and performance â€“ in order to establish a fast and robust pipeline within a multi-disciplinary team.
